            <h4 class="bold">What is Kanban?</h4>

            <p>Kanban is a popular Lean workflow management method for defining, managing, and improving services
                that
                deliver knowledge work. It helps you visualize work, maximize efficiency, and improve continuously.
                Work
                is represented on Kanban boards, allowing you to optimize work delivery across multiple teams and
                handle
                even the most complex projects in a single environment.</p><br>
            <p>To visualize your process with a Kanban system, you will need a board with cards and columns. Each
                column
                on the board represents a step in your workflow. Each Kanban card represents a work item. The Kanban
                board itself represents the actual state of your workflow with all its risks and specifications.</p><br>
            <p>The first and most important thing for you is understanding what it takes to get an item from a
                request
                to a deliverable product. Recognizing how work flows through your system will set you on the path to
                continuous improvement by making well-observed and necessary changes.</p><br>
            <p>When you start working on item X, you pull it from the “To Do” column, and when it is completed, you
                move
                it to “Done”. This way, you can easily track progress and spot bottlenecks. Naturally, your Kanban
                board
                might have a different outlook as it depends on your specific needs and processes.</p>

            <h4 class="bold">How to use the board:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>The first step is to create a contact. This contact is needed to assign the task to a person
                        later on. The first name, last name and email address are mandatory information and have to
                        be entered. The phone number is optional.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The next step is to create a task. This can be done via the board, the Add Task tab or
                        directly in the contact list. With the task you can define a task with a due date, assign
                        the responsible persons and add a description. This task is then visible on the board and
                        can be managed there.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The board can be used to manage, edit and delete created tasks. These can be moved to the
                        corresponding columns 'To do', 'In progress', 'Awaiting feedback' and 'Done' via drag and
                        drop to represent the current status.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
